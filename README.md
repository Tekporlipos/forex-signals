Perfect — that’s excellent confirmation ✅

Your output shows that Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is fully installed as a Windows AppX package at:

C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_2004.2021.825.0_x64__79rhkp1fndgsc

Now we just need to launch it manually once so it can register itself with WSL.

⸻

🧭 Step 1 — Go to the install folder

Run this in PowerShell as Administrator:

cd "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_2004.2021.825.0_x64__79rhkp1fndgsc"

⚠️ This folder is protected. If you get “Access Denied”, use:

Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs

then repeat the cd command above.

⸻

🧩 Step 2 — Look for the launcher EXE

Run:

dir

You should see a file named one of these:
	•	ubuntu2004.exe
	•	ubuntu.exe
	•	or sometimes ubuntu2204.exe depending on the build.

⸻

🚀 Step 3 — Launch it directly

Run whichever one appears:

.\ubuntu2004.exe

or

.\ubuntu.exe

You should see:

Installing, this may take a few minutes...

Then:

Enter new UNIX username:

That’s Ubuntu setting itself up and registering in WSL.

⸻

🧰 Step 4 — Verify registration

Once that finishes, check:

wsl --list --verbose

Expected output:

NAME            STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu-20.04  Running         2


⸻

After that, you can start it anytime with:

wsl -d Ubuntu-20.04

or from the Start Menu → Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

⸻

Would you like me to give you a one-liner PowerShell command that automatically finds and launches the correct .exe inside the WindowsApps folder for you (in case you prefer not to navigate into that hidden path manually)?
