 Hello,
 
Prasad asked me to reach out if you can provision a GitLab repository for the new wealth frontend forecaster and optimiser for me?
 
I reached out to Romain but seems he is busy
 
Do you have the link to the repo?
 
Hello btw
 
No, I learnt is a new profit 
 
project*
 
the is SK-frontend but i am told we will be building new one
 
Hmmm not sure then. I'll take a look but I think you will have to go through Romain, I don't have authority to authorise anyone.
 
okay will inform Prasad then
 
Not sure it has been created yet?
 
Is not created, there is existing project called SK-front but Prasad told me we will be building a new one from it
 
Yeah, sorry don't know anything about it.  I would guess we would be starting from scratch and using the existing one as a reference.  
 
yes 
 
but the repository is not created yet
 
Coles, Simeon (Digital Finance, Group Finance)
Yeah, sorry don't know anything about it.  I would guess we would be starting from scratch and using the existing one as a reference.
