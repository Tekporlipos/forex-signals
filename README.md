Got it â€” thanks for the details.
The error code 0x8000ffff means a catastrophic failure occurred while installing the WSL distribution. Itâ€™s actually a fairly common issue when WSL components or the Windows Store infrastructure are misconfigured.

Letâ€™s go step by step to fix it. ðŸ‘‡

â¸»

ðŸ§© Step 1: Make sure WSL and virtualization are enabled

Run these in PowerShell (as Administrator):

dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

Then reboot your PC.

ðŸ§© Step 2: Update WSL to the latest version

After reboot, run:

wsl --update
wsl --set-default-version 2

This ensures the WSL kernel and tools are current.

ðŸ§© Step 3: Clean up any partial Ubuntu install

If the previous installation failed halfway, remove the broken registration:

wsl --unregister Ubuntu-20.04

No error is okay (it means it wasnâ€™t registered yet).

â¸»

ðŸ§© Step 4: Try again to install Ubuntu

Now reinstall:

wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04

If it still fails, try manually installing via the Microsoft Store GUI:
	1.	Open the Microsoft Store app.
	2.	Search for Ubuntu 20.04.
	3.	Click Get or Install.

This method uses the Store backend rather than the command-line installer, which often avoids 0x8000ffff.

ðŸ§© Step 5 (if error persists): Repair Windows Store components

If the Store backend is corrupted, run:

wsreset.exe

Then, if that doesnâ€™t help:

Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.StorePurchaseApp | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

Then reboot and try again.

â¸»

ðŸ’¡ Optional sanity check

Run:

wsl --status

It should output something like:

Default Version: 2
Kernel version: 5.x.x

If that command fails, WSL isnâ€™t properly initialized yet.

Would you like me to tailor these steps for your specific Windows version (e.g., Windows 10 vs 11, and build number)?
You can find it quickly by typing winver and telling me what it shows.
