Perfect — you’re almost there now 🎯

That message is very clear and easy to fix.
It means:

✅ WSL 2 is installed
❌ But the “Virtual Machine Platform” feature (required for WSL2’s virtualization layer) isn’t enabled, or virtualization is turned off in BIOS.

Let’s fix both parts — it takes just a few commands and one reboot 👇

⸻

🧩 Step 1 — Enable the required Windows features

Run PowerShell as Administrator, then paste:

dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

Then reboot your PC.

🧭 Step 2 — Enable virtualization in BIOS (if needed)

If after reboot you still get that same message, your CPU’s virtualization option might be disabled.

To check:
	1.	Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc → open Task Manager.
	2.	Go to Performance → CPU tab.
	3.	Look for “Virtualization:” on the bottom-right.

If it says:
	•	Enabled → you’re good ✅
	•	Disabled → you need to turn it on in BIOS/UEFI.

To enable it:
	1.	Reboot your computer.
	2.	Press the key shown for BIOS/UEFI setup (usually Del, F2, or F10).
	3.	Find and enable one of these options:
	•	Intel VT-x / Intel Virtualization Technology
	•	AMD-V
	4.	Save and exit.

🧰 Step 3 — Confirm everything works

Back in Windows PowerShell, check:

wsl --status

You should now see something like:

Default Version: 2
Kernel version: 5.x.x.x
WSL version: 1.3.x

Then start your Ubuntu instance:

wsl -d Ubuntu-20.04

Once you see the “Installing…” message and it asks for a UNIX username, you’re done 🎉

Would you like me to tell you exactly what BIOS option name to look for (Intel vs AMD system)? You can just tell me your CPU model.
